```
I have a landing page template with specific JavaScript functionality that must be preserved. I need you to create a new landing page for [NICHE] targeting the Algerian market.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS - DO NOT CHANGE:
1. Keep ALL form element IDs exactly as they are: orderForm, fullName, phone, wilaya, commune, size, color, quantity, deliveryType, productPrice, deliveryPrice, totalPrice, terms, modal
2. Keep ALL data attributes: data-dynamic-form, data-slide
3. Keep ALL class names used by JavaScript: gallery-slide, active, thumbnail, faq-item, faq-question, faq-answer, faq-icon, modal, btn-primary
4. Keep the exact form structure and input types
5. Keep onclick handlers: changeSlide(), goToSlide(), toggleFAQ(), closeModal()
6. Keep the gallery structure with 6 slides
7. Keep external script references: <script src="/js/page.js"></script> and <script src="/js/main.js"></script>

WHAT YOU CAN CHANGE:
- All colors and CSS variables in :root
- Background gradients and visual styling
- Typography sizes and weights
- Images (use Unsplash URLs relevant to the niche)
- Product price and descriptions
- Section content and copy (in Arabic)
- Icons and decorative elements
- Hover effects and animations
- Header/footer design
- But keep the same semantic structure

NEW NICHE DETAILS:
- Product: [PRODUCT NAME]
- Price: [PRICE] ÿØ.ÿ¨
- Color scheme: [COLORS - e.g., "premium blue and silver for electronics", "warm red and cream for food", "deep purple and gold for cosmetics"]
- Target audience: Algerian consumers
- Design style: [modern/luxury/minimal/bold/elegant]

DESIGN GUIDELINES:
- Make it visually stunning and conversion-focused
- Use appropriate imagery for the niche from Unsplash
- Adapt the features section to highlight product benefits
- Update FAQ questions relevant to the product
- Keep it mobile-responsive
- Maintain RTL (right-to-left) Arabic layout
- Use emojis sparingly but effectively

Provide the complete HTML file from <!DOCTYPE html> to </html> with no truncation.
